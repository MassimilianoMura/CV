## Massimiliano Mura

Hi, I’m Massi, a wannabe Junior Developer. After my degree in Law and a career in music industry I flew to London in order to learn how to write code. I studied code at General Assembly and Makers Academy and now I am looking for a job because I want to learn more and more.

## Skills

During the last 9 months I learned how to write code, how to do pair programming and how to deliver high quality software working in a team doing TDD.

#### Front-end development

I learnt how use client-side Javascript and test it, vanilla Js and Js frameworks, end to end testing, css and Sass. Here you can see some example:
- Final and personal project for GA course, my first approach to responsive design: [Rent Splitter](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/Rent-Splitter)
- My todo list app, one weekend project, where I start to learn angularJs: [MassiTodo](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/MassiToDo)

#### Back-end development

During my experience in Makers Academy I learnt how use Ruby and Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord, PostreSQL, Rspec and Capybara, here an example:
- A basic Instagram clone, one weekend project: [MassiGram](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/MassiGram)
