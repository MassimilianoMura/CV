## Massimiliano Mura

Hi, I’m Massi, a wannabe Junior Developer. After my degree in Law and a career in the music industry I flew to London to learn how to write code. I studied code at General Assembly and Makers Academy and now I am looking for a job because I want to learn more and more.

## Skills

During the last 9 months I've been studying how to write code, how to do pair programming and how to deliver high quality software working in a team doing TDD.

#### Front-end development

I studied how to use client-side Javascript (vanilla Js and Js frameworks), unit testing, end to end testing, css and Sass. 

Here you can see an example:
- Final and personal project for the General Assembly course, my first approach to responsive design: [Rent Splitter](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/Rent-Splitter)

#### Back-end/full-stack development

During my experience in Makers Academy I studied how to use Ruby, Rails, Node.js, AngularJs, ActiveRecord, PostreSQL, Rspec, Capybara, continuous integration etc.

Here a few examples:
- My todo list app, one weekend project, where I started to study angularJs, Node.js, Express: [MassiTodo](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/MassiToDo)
- A basic Instagram clone, one weekend project using Rails: [MassiGram](https://github.com/MassimilianoMura/MassiGram)
- Final group project for the Makers Academy course, using Ruby, Rails, AngularJs, Ionic, Protractor, Karma, Selenium: [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org) (WIP!)
